# audio-scripts

Just some helper scripts to automatically process DJ sets, and other raw recordings. 

It should **normalize**, **limit**(for more headroom), **trim**(usuall property of recordings) and **encode into mp3**.
It is meant to work like hammer so don't expect shiney sprinkles on top.

Usage:
`./normalize_dir.sh "MY_DJ_SETS_DIRECTORY_WITH WAVS" -limiter`

`-limiter` option is optional
